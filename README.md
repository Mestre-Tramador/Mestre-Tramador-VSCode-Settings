# Mestre Tramador's VS Code Settings

This is a simple set of `json` snippets to use inside the `.vscode/settings.json` file. Currently it hosts most of my settings to projects used in GitHub, but much more are coming!

## Contribution

I made this a public repository to help me with copying and pasting the settings, but also to help anyone who want this!

If you want to contribute, please call me!
